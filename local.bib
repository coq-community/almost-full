	Abstract = {Rewriting is an essential tool for computer-based reasoning, both automated and assisted. 
It is so because rewriting is a general notion that permits to model a wide range of problems and 
provides means to effectively solve them. In a proof assistant, rewriting can be used to replace terms in 
arbitrary contexts, generalizing the usual equational reasoning to reasoning modulo arbitrary relations. 
This can be done provided the necessary proofs that functions appearing in goals are congruent with 
respect to specific relations. We present a new implementation of generalized rewriting in the Coq proof 
assistant, making essential use of the expressive power of dependent types and a recently implemented 
type class mechanism. The tactic improves on and generalizes previous versions by supporting natively 
higher-order functions, polymorphism and subrelations. The type class system inspired from Haskell 
provides a perfect interface between the user and such tactics, making them easily extensible.}}
